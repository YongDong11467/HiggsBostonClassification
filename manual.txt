Manual
Simply run the code. Results of code are printed out to the terminal or displayed as pop up graphs.
Libraries used are pandas,  numpy, sklearn.svm import SVC, sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier, sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, matplotlib.pyplot
If libraries are not already installed, use pip install.
Certain values of C, such as values over 1, for SVM took too long to run. We removed these values that took a long time, but if desired they can be input through the variable “C_list”.
